### Quick Start

In order to launch the web server, you need to have a mongodb instance running.

```
   mongodb
```

Then you can download all the dependencies and start the server.

```
    npm install
	node server.js
```   

Now, you can click [here](http://localhost:8080) and enjoy the app !

### Routes
The REST route ```/setup``` allows you to have a few data on your database in order to test the app. The users registered are :

1. username : ***lemur*** - password : ***11***
2. username : ***azara*** - password : ***11***

### Thanks !
